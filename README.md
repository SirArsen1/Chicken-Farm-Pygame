# Devlog
## Aug 19th 2025
Fixed the bug with Add_Chick_Btn and Kill_Chick_Btn
Shop opened its doors! New shop button has been added, now new window appears in which player can add items to cart (or remove them if they changed their mind). Although, buying feature is still in works, since it requires to make inventory, wallet and sell features.

Add and Kill chicken buttons are now working
Known bugs:
Sometimes chicken does not appear or disappear after first click, requiring to click the buttons twice

Implemented pygame sprites, which will drastically ease the work. The implementation still not fully done though. Regardless it will speed things up a lot and I can actually see how to move forward with the project!

Finally managed to make eggs to passively spawn each 5 seconds, without stopping the whole program. Now it just needs some polishing.
